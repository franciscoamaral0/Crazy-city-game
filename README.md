#### About.

Project carried out as part of the web development bootcamp held at <b>IRONHACK </b> The game takes place in a big city, where there are pedestrians intensely crossing the street, our illustrious driver, <b>Mario</b>, will have to dodge, the problem is that there are some citizens who run when crossing. Our Mario will have to be very careful to reach the end of the avenue.

---------------

#### How to Play.

Keys for movement will be keyboard arrows + WASD. The player will have 35 seconds to pass pedestrians, but each pedestrian will have their own speed. If the player runs over the pedestrian or runs out of time, he will not score any points. If successful, your points will be the amount of seconds left.
